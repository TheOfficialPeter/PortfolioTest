# Portfolio Test Website

I saw a similar design on Jekyll themes site and decided to recreate my own version. I was still a beginner with Vanilla JS so it's really messy but I did however add some extra customization features to change the backgrounds and adding new cards using the .txt files in the repo.

Here is a preview of the site:
